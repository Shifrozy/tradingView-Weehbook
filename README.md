# ðŸ“ˆ TradingView â†’ Webhook Integration

This project shows how to send **TradingView alerts** to your own webhook endpoint, catch the JSON payload, and use it however you like (save logs, trigger trades, or annoy your cat with a buzzer every time Bitcoin hits $69k ðŸš€).

## âœ¨ How It Works

1. **TradingView Alert**  
   - Create an alert in TradingView (on a chart, indicator, or Pine strategy).
   - Use the **Webhook URL** option and point it to your server.

2. **Webhook Receiver**  
   - A simple server listens for TradingViewâ€™s `POST` request.  
   - It reads the JSON payload, then you can store it in a database or forward it elsewhere.

3. **Your Data, Your Rules**  
   - Save alerts into a file or DB.  
   - Connect to an exchange/broker API for automated trading.  
   - Integrate with Slack/Telegram/Discord for instant updates.
